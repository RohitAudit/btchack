# Raga Finance
Raga finance enables cross chain yield generation. The yield generated through raga can be acccessed on any L1 and L2
For this hackathon, we build the solution for 
1. [Rooch network]("https://rooch.network/")  
2. [fractal]("https://www.fractalbitcoin.io/")

Users can bridge eth/usdc from ethereum and get the native BRC20 token on fractal and Coin on rooch network and these assets are backed by assets on ethereum. The value of asset goes up with time as the vaults earn rewards.

## Project Components
### Ethereum Vaults Smart Contract
